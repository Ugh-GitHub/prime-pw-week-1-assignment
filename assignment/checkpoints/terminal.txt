# 2 - What is the command for changing directories?
cd
# 3 - What is the command for going back a folder (to a parent directory)?
cd ..
# 4 - What is a quick way to create a new folder?
mkdir "folder name"
# 5 - What output would you expect when you run the command 'ls' in an empty folder? What about a folder containing files?
Nothing, just a new command prompt. Lists the files, from what I've seen with up to 3 files per line, with as many rows as there are files in the folder.
# 6 - What is a quick way to create a new file?
touch "filename.file type"
# 7 - Run 'git --version' in your terminal. What is the output?
git version 2.15.0
# 8 - Why would you run the command 'git status'?
To check if files have been modified on the local machine but have not been pushed to GitHub/central repository
# 9 - What does the command 'git add .' do?
'git add .' essentially boils down to a call for a git operation (the 'git' portion of the input),
using the current directory ('.'), to 'add' it to the list of changes (i.e. staging it) to be included in the next commit
(where the files will then be saved to the local repository)
# 10 - What is the command to push your committed changes to your repo on GitHub?
git push -u origin master
